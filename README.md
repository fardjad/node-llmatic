Use self-hosted LLMs with an OpenAI compatible API

</div>

<hr />

LLMatic can be used as a drop-in replacement for OpenAI's API (see the
supported endpoints). It uses [llama-node](https://github.com/Atome-FE/llama-node)
with [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) backend to run the models locally.

Supported endpoints:

- [x] /completions (stream and non-stream)
- [x] /chat/completions (stream and non-stream)
- [x] /embeddings
- [x] /models

This project is currently a work in progress. At this point, it's recommended
to use it only for ad-hoc development and testing.

## Motivation

The main motivation behind making LLMatic was to experiment with OpenAI's API
without worrying about the cost. I have seen other attempts at creating
OpenAI-Compatible APIs such as:

1. [FastChat](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat/blob/main/docs/openai_api.md)
2. [GPT4All Chat Server Mode](https://docs.gpt4all.io/gpt4all_chat.html#gpt4all-chat-server-mode)
3. [simpleAI](https://github.com/lhenault/simpleAI)

But I wanted a small, simple, and easy to extend implementation in TypeScript based on the
[official OpenAI API specification](https://github.com/openai/openai-openapi/blob/master/openapi.yaml).

## How to use

### Requirements

- Node.js >=18.16
- Unix-based OS (Linux, macOS, WSL, etc.)

### Installation

Create an empty directory and run `npm init`:

```bash
export LLMATIC_PROJECT_DIR=my-llmatic-project
mkdir $LLMATIC_PROJECT_DIR
cd $LLMATIC_PROJECT_DIR
npm init -y
```

Install and configure LLMatic:

```bash
npm add llmatic
# Download a model and generate a config file
npx llmatic config
```

Adjust the config file to your needs and start the server:

```bash
npx llmatic start
```

You can run `llmatic --help` to see all available commands.

### Usage with [chatbot-ui](https://github.com/mckaywrigley/chatbot-ui)

Clone the repo and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mckaywrigley/chatbot-ui.git
cd chatbot-ui
npm install
```

Create a `.env.local` file:

```bash
cat <<EOF > .env.local
# For now, this is ignored by LLMatic
DEFAULT_MODEL=Ignored

NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT=A chat between a curious human (user) and an artificial intelligence assistant (assistant). The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the human's questions.

user: Hello!
assistant: Hello! How may I help you today?
user: Please tell me the largest city in Europe.
assistant: Sure. The largest city in Europe is Moscow, the capital of Russia.

OPENAI_API_KEY=ANYTHING_WILL_DO
OPENAI_API_HOST=http://localhost:3000

GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
GOOGLE_CSE_ID=YOUR_ENGINE_ID
EOF
```

Run the server:

```bash
npm run dev -- --port 3001
```

### Usage with [LangChain](https://langchain.com)

There are two examples of using LLMatic with LangChain in the
[`examples`](/examples) directory.

To run the Node.js example, first install the dependencies:

```bash
cd examples/node-langchain
npm install
```

Then run the main script:

```bash
npm start
```
